News: Making RSS Scale   I've been meaning to write about this since I saw a one-page article on  the subject of RSS clogging websites' bandwidth in NewScientist  back in June. But it wasn't until I saw  this  Slashdot story on the same subject that I knew I had to get my  thoughts down. A lot of sites are suffering from a big problem  mdash;  they are being systematically hammered by RSS newsreaders for new material  at regular intervals.        When I first came across RSS around two years ago and did some reading  up on it, it sounded like another interesting protocol for a nonproblem.  I wondered what was wrong with just refreshing a ""What's new?"" page.  (I have a natural scepticism towards new and exotic protocols.) Nonetheless,  after RSS established a niche in the realm of informing us,  rolling news style, of new network content, I recognised its usefulness  in this situation. I did still feel that its design was suboptimal, no  matter how many thousands of bloggers now relied on it.

Adult Homo Florensiensis, nicknamed ""Hobbits"" by the dig workers who helped uncover the remains at the Liang Bua cave on the island of Flores in Indonesia, were about the size of a three-year-old modern human child, but had a brain one-third the size. Stone tools and pygmy elephant bones found at the site indicate that these ""Hobbits"" hunted co-operatively together in groups, meaning that they must have had language. ""The whole idea that you need a particular brain size to do anything intelligent is completely blown away by this find,"" commented Dr Henry Gee of Nature magazine to the BBC.
